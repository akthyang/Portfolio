    <p>
        Hi! My name is Alicia Yang. I am majoring in Computer Science and Chinese, 
        with a minor in mathematics. I have interned as a tech support at OTI, web design and news research 
        intern at Icarus (a school newspaper), and developed a case study about telecommunications, comparing Zoom and Skype, at Driving Forward.
        Right now, I am interested and trying to learn more about artificial intelligence and its impact in the medical field because I am interested in pursuing 
        a career in this field. Finally, during my free time, I like to read books (as long as it's fiction, but that's a secret), watch TV shows and take long walks.
    </p>

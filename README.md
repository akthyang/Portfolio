# Portfolio
A sample portfolio website created with Python and Django and deployed on Railway.
**Please note there are not a lot of projects available in this project and there is an error where media files are not loading when this app is deployed. I am already looking into this issue. Thank you.**

## Overview

### Home Page
The home page has 3 sections and traversing to each section will trigger a small animation, but the animation itself may a take a few seconds to load.
